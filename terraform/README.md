# Terraform

This directory contains configuration for AWS resources currently needed by the application. The Logseq Sync protocol has the client upload blobs to a S3-compatible blob store, this is a codified version of the infrastructure needed to set that up.

Longer term, I still need to figure out if other blob stores (MinIO, other S3-compatible stores) can be used, or if assumptions about S3 are baked into the protocol, but to get things working end-to-end first, I figured it prudent to start with what the official implementation does.
